    "text": "Chancellor’s Ambassador\nAs a Chancellor’s Ambassador, it is my responsibility to engage with administration, facilities, staff, and students alike to create a campus experience that is collaborative and fulfilling for everyone. I achieve through developing connections with students and staff to be a waypoint for any concerns or ideas. Listed below are descriptions of organizations and projects I am part of to be involved on and improve campus:\nOutdoor seating\nThe state of the wooden outdoor seating is poor currently. These picnic benches have been around for many years, but have not been properly maintained. I plan to bring students together to help me sand, repaint, and refinish the wooden picnic tables so our outdoor seating is once again maintained.\n“I See You”\nI am working with UNK Grounds to coordinate a time to help finish the “I See You” art exhibit in front of the Union by putting rock around the statues. We will also be laying sod, and will need student help to make quick work of this project.\nMen’s and Copeland Exterior\nMen’s Hall and Copeland Hall are a core part of UNK’s identity. Both often shown to prospective students in tours, and Men’s is home to the UNK Honors Program. However, the exterior of the buildings have grown grimy and ugly due to neglect, and requires a good cleaning. I plan to work with Tanner Cooper and HAO to pressure wash the exterior of Men’s Hall, and later work on cleaning Copeland.\nOtto Olsen Development\nI am currently proposing and acquiring funding for a development of the Northeast corner of the old Otto Olsen lot on campus. Below is the proposal with renderings:"

I’m Caleb Rother, a sophomore at the University of Nebraska at Kearney (UNK) majoring in Molecular Biology with a minor in Media Production.\nI am actively involved on campus through Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL), the Honors Program, and my undergraduate research. I love making new friends throughout campus, and aim to have a diverse perspective of UNK. I aim to improve the campus, community, and culture of UNK through a variety of projects and initiatives.\nRead more about my campus projects\nI hope to leave UNK with a strong foundation in scientific concepts, especially relating to host-pathogen interactions and immunology. I believe a good scientist should have strong communication skills, not just with other scientists, but also with the general public.\nRead more about my research\n\n\n\n\nCreated by Caleb Rother 2025 | University of Nebraska at Kearney"

    "text": "The majority of skin infections are from Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in about 1% of all hospital visits. That may not sound like a lot, but from 2001-2003, that was over 11 million visits! It is very likely that you know someone who has had a Staph infection.\nStaph infections are a big problem, causing billions of dollars of healthcare costs each year, and the problem hasn’t been getting any better. With the rise of antibiotic resistance, these infections have been getting harder and harder to treat. These aren’t small, harmless infections, either! \nStaph infections are known to be very virulent, which means that they are very good at causing disease and generally being nasty. They can cause flesh to rot, serious disfigurement, and even death if they don’t get treated! \nMy research focuses on one mechanism S. aureus uses to be so nasty. This mechanism is called the Type Seven Secretion System (T7SS). You can think of the T7SS as a sewage pump. S. aureus constantly makes many different virulence factors. Think of these as toxins. These virulence factors are proteins that the bacteria produces inside that need to get out to cause damage. These proteins have one job: cause chaos. \nSince these toxins, the virulence factors of the T7SS, are trapped inside of the cell, they need a way out. However, these toxins are large and chunky, and can’t just leave the cell. Since the cell can’t let everything else inside it leave along with the toxins, the cell came up with a pathway to let just the toxins out. This is the T7SS. \nAs the toxins continue to build up in the cell, it will tell the T7SS to start pumping them out. Once these toxins are out, they can start causing the chaos they are designed for. Some of these toxins attack DNA, while others help fight against other bacteria for resources. My research specifically focuses on how these toxins help hide the bacteria from our immune system. \nI do this by studying how the T7SS impacts different aspects of our immune system. Specifically, I am looking at components of our innate immune system. This is the part of our immune system that are first responders. The moment you get a cut, your innate immune system jumps into action to fight any bacteria or viruses that get in. \nFruit flies have an innate immune system that is very similar to human’s, so I infect fruit flies with our Staph infections that have the T7SS and ones that don’t (we genetically remove the T7SS from the bacteria). This lets me test how well the bacteria can survive in the innate immune environment, as well as how much the T7SS is responsible for killing the flies. \nI also look at a specific part of the innate immune system. These are cells called macrophages, which are big, angry immune cells that will eat anything that gets into our bodies that isn’t supposed to be there. However, the T7SS appears to be important for how well the bacteria can avoid the macrophages, as well as for surviving within the macrophages when if it does get eaten.\nOverall, my research is focused on how the T7SS, a system that pumps toxins out of S. aureus, impacts the bacteria’s ability to survive the innate immune system. If we can figure out how the T7SS helps Staph infections hide from and fight against our immune system, we might be able to design treatments that block it–and make these infections easier to treat.\n2025 Goldwater Application on T7SS Research\n\n\n\n\n\nCruikshank et. al, 2024\n\n\n&lt;/p&gt;"
